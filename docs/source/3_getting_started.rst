Getting Started
===============

We'll start by running a simple test workflow, exploring it via the web interface, and terminating it.  Then
you'll be ready to start learning how to write your own.

Execute an Example Workflow
___________________________

The console will generate a lot of output as the workflow runs.  This workflow tests out various
features of Cosmos.  The number beside each object inside brackets, `[#]`, is the SQL ID of that object.  Clone the
git repository so that you have access to the examples code:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/Mizzou-CBMI/COSMOS2 Cosmos
    $ cd Cosmos/examples
    $ python ex2.py

Launch the Web Interface
________________________

You can use the web interface to explore the history and debug all workflows.  Features include:


* Visualizing all jobs as a dependency graph (not useful if there are too many jobs)
* Visualizing the stages as a dependency graph (high level overview)
* Search for particular tasks based on their params or other attributes
* See resource usage statistics
* For any task, view the exact command that was executed, stdout, stderr, resource usage, inputs/outputs, dependencies, etc.

.. code-block:: bash

   cosmos runweb sqlite.db

Visit `<http://servername:8080>`_ to access it (or `<http://localhost:8080>`_ if you're running cosmos locally.


.. figure:: /_static/imgs/web_interface.png
   :align: center

.. hint::

    If the cosmos webserver is running, but you can't connect, it is likely because there is a firewall
    in front of the server.  You can get around it by using **ssh port forwarding**, for example:
    ``$ ssh -L 8080:servername:8080 user@server``.

.. warning::

    `cosmos runweb` uses the Flask development webserver which is **NOT** secure.  If you need it secured, you'll have to set it up in a production
    Flask web server environment, see `Deploying Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/deploying/>`_.  For example, you can use
    `gunicorn 'cosmos.web.gunicorn:make_app("sqlite:///examples/sqlite.db")' -w 6 -b 0.0.0.0:3232`

Terminating a Workflow
______________________

To terminate a workflow, simply press ctrl+c (or send the process a SIGINT signal) in the terminal.
Cosmos will terminate running jobs and mark them as failed.
You can resume from the point in the workflow you left off later.

Resuming a workflow
____________________

A workflow can be resumed by re-running the script that originally started it.  The call to :meth:`Cosmos.start` will delete any failed Tasks.
Calls to :meth:`Workflow.add_task` will check the database to see if the Task already has been successfully completed (using the stage_name and uid).  If so,
it'll return the database version of that Task, and not re-run it when :meth:`Workflow.run` is called.  If the Task had failed, :meth:`Workflow.add_task` will
return a new Task which *will* be run when :meth:`Workflow.run` is called.
